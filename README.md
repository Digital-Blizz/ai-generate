## About

The AI Generate Project is an initiative by Digital Blizz to blend technology and creativity. By harnessing the power of AI, we strive to push the boundaries of digital art and inspire new forms of artistic expression.

## Installation

To get started with the AI Generate Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DigitalBlizz/ai-generate.git
    cd ai-generate
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to generate art using our AI model:

1. Load a pre-trained model:
    ```python
    from ai_generate import load_model
    model = load_model('path/to/pretrained/model')
    ```

2. Generate art:
    ```python
    generated_art = model.generate(prompt="A sunset over a futuristic city")
    generated_art.save('output.png')
    ```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the [documentation](docs/USAGE.md).
